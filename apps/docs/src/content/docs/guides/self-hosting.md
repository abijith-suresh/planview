description: What you can run locally today and the status of a self-hosted cloud application.

## Local previews

The CLI and its preview server already run on your computer without an account.
[Install the CLI](../install-cli/), then publish a file or a folder:

```sh
planview publish --open ./page.html
planview publish --open ./my-page/
```

Documents stay in your local user profile. The preview server binds to localhost;
it is not a public web server or a way to share links with other devices.

## The cloud application

A supported self-hosted cloud installation is still being designed. There is no
Docker Compose installer or documented home-server installation to follow yet.

The current cloud app uses Convex for accounts and metadata and UploadThing for
file storage. Hosting the app on your server alone does not replace those services.
The [self-hosting proposal](https://github.com/abijith-suresh/planview/pull/129)
covers storage adapters, authentication, backups and upgrades.

For contributor setup rather than a supported installation, see
[repository development](../../reference/development/) and
[architecture](../../reference/architecture/).
