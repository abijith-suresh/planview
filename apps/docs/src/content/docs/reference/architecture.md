## Applications

| Workspace | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/app` | SolidStart account workspace, auth proxy, cloud upload/preview routes, hosted MCP |
| `apps/site` | Static Astro marketing pages |
| `apps/docs` | Static Astro + Starlight guides and search |
| `apps/cli` | The `plansplease` command and bundled local runtime |

Site and docs have independent builds and deployments. They link to the app;
they do not host its sessions or import its server implementation. The public
product is named plansplease while repository and package identifiers stay planview.

## Local packages

The CLI calls `@planview/local`, which coordinates publication and daemon
lifecycle through typed Effect operations.

| Package | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `@planview/core` | Document IDs, paths, validation, bundle format, fixed local policy |
| `@planview/local` | Local application API and preparing file/folder snapshots |
| `@planview/daemon` | Detached loopback process, authenticated lifecycle management, HTTP delivery |
| `@planview/storage` | SQLite metadata, immutable files, publication staging/finalization |

Storage does not own URLs or HTTP behavior. Core performs no filesystem or cloud
I/O; its narrow defaults read platform paths and generate IDs. The public CLI
bundles private packages so installation does not require publishing them.

## Cloud data and auth

Better Auth runs through the Convex component. The app proxies auth endpoints
and obtains a Convex token for session-authenticated requests. Convex owns
account/document metadata, owner checks, OAuth state, upload credentials,
quota reservations, and cleanup jobs. UploadThing owns the file bytes.

Convex has separate API and HTTP action origins. `CONVEX_URL` selects the API
backend; `CONVEX_SITE_URL` selects HTTP/auth actions. Local CLI-generated aliases
are `VITE_CONVEX_URL` and `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL`. `SITE_URL` means the **app** public
origin, even though its name might suggest the marketing service.

Browser sessions, upload-only CLI credentials, and MCP OAuth tokens are different
credentials. A CLI token is accepted only by the upload flow. MCP validates its
resource audience and `cloud:documents` scope and binds backend operations to
the authorized account.

## Upload lifecycle on main

1. Validate the HTML bytes and metadata.
2. Reserve the encoded size against the account quota in a backend transaction.
3. Upload to the provider with an absolute deadline.
4. Commit document metadata using short-lived server proofs.
5. Reconcile failure or queue provider cleanup without prematurely releasing quota.

Uncertain provider outcomes stay charged until reconciled. Storage metadata uses
a provider name and logical locator; an owner-bound UploadThing custom ID supports
cleanup even when a provider response is lost. Server proofs do not go to browsers.

The provider adapter and direct browser delivery refactor are
[under review](../planned-features/). Current standalone previews use the app
route; do not assume all delivery avoids app bandwidth.
