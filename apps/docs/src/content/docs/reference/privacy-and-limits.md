title: Privacy and limits
description: What account access protects, what is public during alpha, and the current size limits.

## Cloud alpha

The workspace checks who owns a document before listing, reading, or deleting
it through the app. MCP tools are scoped to the account that authorized the client.

**UploadThing files have public direct URLs during alpha.** Someone who obtains
an object URL can fetch its bytes without your workspace session. Account checks
and sandboxing do not make those stored objects private. Use non-sensitive test
content when trying the product with friends.

An explicit unlisted sharing feature is under review. Its proposal is different
from search visibility or per-recipient permissions. Do not rely on it until
its implementation is merged and deployed.

## Rendering

Uploaded HTML runs in an opaque-origin sandbox without access to the workspace's
cookies or browser storage. Generated JavaScript can still execute and fetch
permitted external resources. Keep credentials out of document content.

A preview is not an offline archive of remote assets. If it references a hosted
font, image, stylesheet, or API, that provider can receive a request from the
viewer's browser.

## Limits on main

| Workflow | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Local HTML or encoded artifact folder | 10 MiB per snapshot |
| Files in a local artifact folder | 512, with root `index.html` |
| Current cloud standalone HTML upload | 8 MiB of encoded bytes |
| MCP document read | 32,768 characters per call |
| MCP document list | 50 records per page maximum |
| Account quota implementation | Configurable; defaults to 500,000,000 bytes |

The 500 MB quota is merged into the repository but not deployed to staging at
this documentation review on **2 October 2026**. It counts stored files,
reservations, pending deletion, and unresolved provider outcomes. It releases
charged capacity only when cleanup is confirmed. The object limit uses binary
MiB; the account default uses decimal MB.

Paid plans and unlimited storage are not available or promised. Cloud bundles
would count their complete encoded object, including the manifest, against the
same quota once their separate feature is approved.

## Local retention and deletion

The local daemon keeps snapshots for 30 days since last successful access.
Cleanup runs at startup and every 24 hours, or when `plansplease clean` runs.
Local state is private to the user profile and the daemon binds to loopback.

Cloud deletion hides the document and queues provider cleanup with retries.
Previously downloaded copies can remain elsewhere. There is no cloud retention
or automatic expiry promise today.

## Documentation itself

These docs are static and public. Search runs against a locally served Pagefind
index; there is no configured analytics service. Fonts are served with the docs.
Signing in happens on the separate app origin, not on this documentation service.
