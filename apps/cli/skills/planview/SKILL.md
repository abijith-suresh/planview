# plansplease

Use plansplease to give agent-generated HTML a local URL or save a standalone page to
plansplease. The command is `plansplease`; the installed skill directory remains
`planview`. Choose the workflow that matches where the page needs to live.

## Local preview

Publish a `.html` or `.htm` file, or a folder with a root `index.html` and its assets:

```sh
plansplease publish --open ./report.html
plansplease publish --open ./site
```

Omit `--open` when you only need the URL. Local source snapshots have a 10 MiB limit;
bundles accept up to 512 files. Follow source-validation errors rather than stripping
assets to force publication.

Each URL is immutable. Changing the source does not change a published snapshot.
Publish again after editing. Use the exact printed URL; the daemon prefers port 4777
and selects another port when needed.

```sh
plansplease get <id-or-exact-local-url> > recovered.html
plansplease publish --json ./report.html
```

`get` writes exact standalone HTML bytes. It does not follow a folder-root redirect;
use the browser to view a folder's `index.html` and asset paths.

The daemon starts on demand. `start`, `status`, `stop`, `restart`, and `clean` manage
it; `status` is read-only. Local snapshots expire after 30 days without access.

## Cloud upload from the CLI

Sign in once in the browser, then upload one standalone `.html` file up to 8 MiB:

```sh
plansplease login
plansplease upload --open ./report.html
plansplease upload --json ./report.html
```

`upload` returns the document's workspace preview link. The preview requires the
owning account to be signed in; it is not an anonymous share link. CLI credentials
permit uploads only. `get` reads local snapshots, not cloud documents. To list or
read cloud documents, use hosted MCP or the workspace. `plansplease logout` revokes the
credential and requires a connection.

Use `PLANVIEW_CLOUD_URL` or `plansplease login --cloud-url <origin>` for a different app.
The selected cloud URL and credential are saved in the active CLI profile.

## Hosted MCP

When the plansplease MCP server is connected, use its tools directly. The endpoint
is `<app-origin>/mcp`; connecting requires browser sign-in and explicit consent.
Do not copy CLI credentials into MCP configuration.

- `list_documents` lists cloud documents. Pass its `nextCursor` as `cursor` to
  request the next page until `nextCursor` is `null`.
- `read_document` retrieves HTML in chunks of up to 32,768 characters. Continue
  with the same `id` and pass `nextOffset` as `offset` until it is `null`.
- `upload_document` saves a new standalone HTML document. Pass `title` and `html`,
  with a title of 1 to 200 characters and a maximum UTF-8 HTML size of 8 MiB.
  Each upload creates a separate document.
- `delete_document` takes an `id`, hides the document, and queues storage deletion. Confirm the
  user's intent before deleting work they may want to keep.

There is no revision or update tool yet. Keep the original document when creating
a revised upload, and identify both documents clearly in your response.

## Boundaries

- Cloud file URLs are public during alpha. Do not describe uploads as private.
- Keep the daemon on loopback. Local URLs do not work on another person's machine.
- Pass real source paths and preserve exact document IDs. Do not pass symlink
  sources or unvalidated shell substitutions.
- Errors go to stderr; successful results go to stdout. Commands supporting
  `--json` emit one JSON value. Check exit status before presenting success.
